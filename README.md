This is SUSTech CS209A 2023 Fall course final project demo for students, including a StackOverflow data analysis and visualization web page based on SpringBoot and HTML.

## Preface

This is just a sample demo with a small amount of data and trivial visualization, and you need to **collect and analyse data** according to the document and **design a more beautiful view** by yourself. This demo is to help you to understand the main structure of the code and provide quick start, and you can also redesign it without using this demo.

ðŸ””***Kindly note that this demo uses static data stored in tagCount_demo.js directly within the front-end, which will result in 20 points deductions during evaluation. Hence, it is recommended that the data analysis process be conducted by the server in response to requests from the front-end.***

- The data in this demo is from 50 Java threads in StackOverflow, which are the top 50 ones with the most activity collected on Nov. 19, 2023. 
- The demo is a SpringBoot project with Maven as the package manager, using SpringBoot version 3.1.5, and the default JDK version is 20. The thymeleaf template engine ([see the documentation for more details](https://www.thymeleaf.org/)) is imported through Maven for page rendering. 
- The frontend and backend of this demo are not separated (you can also create a separate front-end and back-end  project), and the frontend uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript (you can use  Vue, React, or any other front-end frameworks). The echarts framework for wordcloud and barchart is imported via jsdelivr CDN ([see the documentation of ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/handbook/en/get-started/)).
- The `data.json` file is an original json file returned from the Stack Exchange API, for reference only. You can specify the returned content by modifying the request url according to [API document](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs). You are highly encouraged to explore the `try it` tool (as shown below) embedded within this document before start.

## Quick Start

#### 1. Create your own repository

If you want to use this demo as the beginning of your final project, Click the [use template](https://github.com/new?template_name=CS209A-Final-Project-Demo&template_owner=Evan-Sukhoi) to create a fork of this template - to avoid potential plagiarism disputes, **please be sure that your repository is made *private* before the deadline**. But it is recommend you start from **create a new project** and copy the `src` folder and `pom.xml` to your hierarchy (it will help you get more familiar with SpringBoot).

#### 2. Load the demo to your computer

Clone your repository to your local machine. You can then open the whole folder as a project in your IDE -  it will recognize the SpringBoot Application structure and automatically configure the project. If you see the hierarchy below, it means success.

If it failed to be recognized  automatically, you can find the `pom.xml` file in IDEA and right click it, and then click `Add as Maven Project`. After indexing, you will see the result above.

#### 3. Run the Demo

##### Using IDEA

Find `Java2FinalProjectDemoApplication.java` in **src -> main -> java -> edu -> sustech -> cs209a -> java2finalprojectdemo** and run it.

If you see the result below, congratulations!ðŸŽ‰

##### Using Terminal

First, make sure you have installed maven. If not, please visit this [link](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi#) to download and remember to add the `/bin` folder to the Environment Variables (for Windows users).

Then, use the command below to package and install the project into your local Maven repository.

```

```

And run the application with command

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

If you see the result below, congratulations!ðŸŽ‰

## How to see the result

After running the project, you can visit [localhost:8090](localhost:8090) (based on your port number) to see the demo result.
